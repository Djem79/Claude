## 2026-05-21 — `next start` does NOT serve `public/` files created after boot

**What happened:** The article-image feature wrote generated images to
`public/images/blog/<slug>.png` and referenced them as static URLs. On the server
those URLs 404'd (build-time `public/` files like the logo served fine; runtime-added
ones did not), which broke the blog thumbnail and made Telegram's channel `sendPhoto`
fail with "failed to get HTTP URL content".

**Root cause:** Next.js `next start` only serves `public/` assets known at start; files
written there afterwards are not served (404) until a restart.

**Rules:**
- Serve runtime-generated images through a **route handler that reads the file via `fs`**
  (e.g. `/api/blog-image`), not as a static `public/` path. `fs.readFileSync` sees new
  files immediately; static serving does not.
- Add `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` to such routes so Cloudflare
  caches the render.
- **Telegram `sendPhoto` by URL is stricter than browsers** — it rejected a route URL
  with query params ("Wrong port number specified in the URL"). Upload the image **bytes
  via multipart** instead (fetch the route locally → `FormData` `photo` Blob). Browsers
  and OG scrapers handle the query URL fine, so the site/og can keep using it.

## 2026-05-21 — Verify request path BEFORE locking an origin firewall

**What happened:** During H3 hardening I assumed `worldwise.pro` was proxied
through Cloudflare (orange cloud) and locked ufw to Cloudflare IP ranges only.
The domain is actually **DNS-only** — it resolves directly to the origin
`62.238.35.20`, so traffic never touches Cloudflare. The lockdown blocked all
real visitors and took the site down for ~30–60s until I rolled back.

**Why it happened:** I trusted CLAUDE.md's "DNS managed via Cloudflare" + the
presence of CF IP ranges in ufw, and inferred proxying without verifying the
actual public DNS resolution or request path.

**Rules to prevent repeat:**
- Before any origin firewall / IP-allowlist change, run `dig +short <domain>` and
  confirm whether it resolves to the proxy (Cloudflare) or the origin IP. DNS-only
  vs proxied changes everything.
- Confirm which header carries the trustworthy client IP for the *actual* topology
  (`x-real-ip` set by nginx when nginx is the edge; `cf-connecting-ip` only when
  CF is genuinely in the path AND origin is CF-locked).
- For risky prod infra changes, keep an open SSH session and a one-command rollback
  ready, and verify externally (`curl https://domain`) immediately after — which is
  how this was caught fast.
- A redundant rule below a specific allowlist (`ALLOW Anywhere`) silently negates
  the allowlist — but removing it is only safe once you've confirmed the proxy is
  actually in front.
